# Battle City - Multiplayer  

## Description  
This is a take on creating a Battle City game clone using Photon and Unity Engine.  
Play as one side of the conflict and try your best at destroying the enemy statue.  
  
I tried my best to recreate the spirit of the original title, which can be seen through the windows and gameplay itself.
